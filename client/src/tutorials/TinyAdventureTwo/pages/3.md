# Running

![](/tutorials/tiny-adventure-two/tinyAdventureTwoDiagram.jpg)

If you â€˜runâ€˜ the program three things will happen.

1. First we find two progam adresses. One for the game data of level 1 and then one chest vault
   to deposit SOL in that we can then give out to the player when they reach the end of the level.
2. Then we call initialize on our program which will initialize these accounts on chain.
   The logged in wallet will pay for these accounts.
3. Then we call resetLevelAndSpawnChest, this will reset the player position to 0 and fill the chest vault account with 0.1 SOL. For that we use a cross program invocation (CPI). So we call the `system_program::transfer` to transfer the SOL to the chest vault account.
4. In a loop we call 3 times moveRight. This will move the character to the right (increase the play position u8). When the player reaches position 3 the reward of the chest account will be transfered to him. Here we can not use a CPI, because the chestVault is not owned by the system program. So we directly access the lamport balance of both accounts and increase the player accounts lamports and decrease the lamportas from the chest_vault. (When using `try_borrow_mut_lamports` you need to make sure that all accounts in sum have the same SOL before and after and changed accounts need to be mutable and be signer and/or owned by the program)
5. You played through the game, gratulations.

Where to go from here?

Being able to give rewards to players gives all kind of possibilities.
You could for example organize a race, or an adventure game where people need to put in certain numbers to solve riddles (text adventure). Or you could add some chances and make a gambling game or add a second dimension to the level and add more movement options and spawn multiple chests.
You could also add a transaction fee for moving which fills up the chests.
Looking forward to see what you are building!
